# Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

#The data has been split into two groups:

training set (train.csv)
test set (test.csv)

The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger
The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenge.
